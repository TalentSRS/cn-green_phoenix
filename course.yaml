  Description of the book: The old house of the Geng family has been
  uninhabited for years. But recently the doors of the house open and
  close without anyone going in or out. And at night one can hear
  people talking and singing inside. One dark evening, Geng Qubing
  sees light shining from the attic. He slips into the house, and sees
  a pretty girl sitting with her family. Deeply attracted to the girl,
  Geng Qubing is determined to find out who she is, where her family
  is from, and why they live in his old house. What eventually
  transpires is a real surprise!
